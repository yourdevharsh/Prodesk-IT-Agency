## ✨ Features Built (Meeting Assignment Requirements)

### Level 1: Core Layout & Responsiveness
*   **Fully Responsive:** Fluid layouts adapting seamlessly from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors using Tailwind Grid and Flexbox.
*   **Navigation:** Left-aligned brand logo with right-aligned navigation links. Includes a custom-built, animated hamburger menu for mobile devices.
*   **Dynamic Sections:** Catchy Hero section, a 3-column Service Grid, an Information/Contact Form layout, and a structured Footer with dynamic copyright year.

### Level 2: Interactivity & UX
*   **Dark Mode Toggle:** User-triggered Dark/Light mode switch built with Vanilla JS. It also respects the user's system preferences (`prefers-color-scheme`).
*   **Micro-Interactions:** 
    *   Smooth hover scaling and color transitions on buttons.
    *   Service cards "lift up" elegantly upon mouse hover.
    *   Dynamic scroll-spy that highlights the current section in the Navbar.
*   **Sticky Navbar:** The header remains fixed at the top of the screen during scrolling for easy navigation.

### Level 3: Advanced UI & Performance
*   **Tech Stack:** Built using **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first styling.
*   **Glassmorphism:** The sticky navbar utilizes the `backdrop-filter` property to create a modern "frosted glass" aesthetic (`backdrop-blur-xl bg-blue-500/20`).
*   **Perfect Lighthouse Score:** Audited via Chrome DevTools to achieve **100/100** in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. (Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and optimized assets).

### Extra features

* **Scroll-Spy (Intersection Observer):** Implemented an IntersectionObserver that tracks which section the user is currently viewing and dynamically adds an underline to the corresponding link in the Navbar.

* **System Theme Detection:** Instead of just a manual Dark Mode toggle, my code uses window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)") to detect the user's OS preference upon loading, and it even listens for system-level changes to update automatically.
* **Smart Mobile Menu Closing:** Added event listeners (touchstart and click) to detect if a user clicks outside the mobile menu or clicks a specific link, ensuring the menu closes automatically.
* **Dynamic Copyright Year:** Rather than hardcoding the year in the footer, I wrote a script (new Date().getFullYear()) to automatically display the current year.
